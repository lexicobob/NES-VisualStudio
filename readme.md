This is an empty Visual Studio Project tailored to NES development. 

This project should be placed in the cc65 directory. 
CC65 is the compiler used. Download CC65 from http://cc65.org/, unpack into a directory, unpack this folder into that directory.

You should have a NES emulator associated with the .nes file extension if you want this to automatically run your program after it's compiled. If you don't want to run the game, remove the last line from compile.bat - %name% 

You can then add NES files to your project directory and use Visual Studio as your NES game IDE. ^^ 

ENJOY!

NOTE:
There's a bat file that runs the compiler. This will have to be edited manually per project at the moment. More updates to come.
